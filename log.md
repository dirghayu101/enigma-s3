# Things to be done for final presentation:
- Tagging algorithm working from the user interface.
    - Should be able to create a new snippet.
    - Should be able to update/overwrite an existing snippet. -> Add new tags? Modify summary? -> Delete tags?
- Search is working from the user interface.





Task: Authentication & authorization setup: - Login, Signup and other user functionalities.
- Authentication requires a fully functional website. It is troublesome to have a partially working website setup with user authentication & authorization.



# Work that needs to be done in the frontend:
- End goal: I should be able to login and sign-up my user. Then I should be able to pass some authentication to a sample lambda function. I should be able to figure out how to verify the token and all of that. For every page I load, I should be able to retrieve the authentication token.
